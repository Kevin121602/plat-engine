Stench
	- SUB_014 is the flinch validation subsequence; invoked by:
		- ServerHirumaseruCheck -> this should get a check for Stench
		- sub_247 (fire fang)
		- sub_248 (thunder fang)
		- sub_249 (ice fang)

Drizzle / Drought / Sand Stream / Snow Warning
	- ST_ServerPokeAppearCheck has a case for all of these
	- need to sedt the field condition to the timed variant

Speed Boost
	- not gonna bother implementing this one, it's stupid

Sturdy
	- hg-engine: btl_scr_cmd_d0_checkshouldleavewith1hp
	- also this: https://github.com/BluRosie/hg-engine/commit/3a571f20e677613c809bc9b6c193d0731a2f3f82

Limber / Insomnia / Immunity / Magma Armor / Water Veil / Vital Spirit:
	- dunno if I wanna bother

Volt / Water Absorb:
	- I don't think these will actually need checks because the respective items only activate on taking damage
	- do these already work on multi-strike moves?
	- ST_ServerDamageTokuseiCheck

Oblivious:
	- Intimidate blocking: ST_ServerPokeAppearCheck has a check for Intimidate
	- Taunt blocking:
		- sub_132 is the taunt application subsequence; need to modify this to fail if the target has Oblivious (sub_014 is a good reference for inner focus vs flinch)

Cloud Nine / Air Lock:
	- Add a case to ST_ServerPokeAppearCheck

Color Change:
	- only activate on last hit:
		- check loop_hit_check in ST_ServerWazaHitTokuseiCheck, activate on false
	- Future Sight / Doom Desire effect:
		- need to update these moves in particular to deal typed damage somehow

Flash Fire:
	- modify ST_ServerDamageTokuseiCheck, remove condition check

Own Tempo:
	- Intimidate blocking: see Oblivious
	- baton pass confusion cure: lol idk

Intimidate:
	- message change is a message change to all stat-lowering abilities (which is fine tbh, pop-ups account for this)

Shadow Tag / Magnet Pull / Arena Trap:
	- Ghost type immunity:
		- ST_EscapeNGCheck looks like the fleeing check
		- ST_ServerPokemonSelectCheck is the switch check? apparently

Wonder Guard:
	- ST_TameWazaTurnCheck: 273 -> 272 (Fire Fang -> Shadow Force)

Levitate:
	- ST_ServerTypeCheck: Change the return type to No Effect (Koukanai)
	- ST_AITypeCheck: No change needed

Effect Spore:
	- ST_ServerWazaHitTokuseiCheck has a switch case

Synchronize:
	- Inflict Toxic:
		- ST_ServerSinkuroCheck has a check for all poison
	- Psycho Shift might just happen naturally, depends on the script
	- Toxic Spikes, need to check how the hazards code works

Lightning Rod / Storm Drain:
	- Checks are in ST_ServerDefenceClientTokuseiCheck
		- this code needs to be totally reworked tbh
		- need to have a separate subseq probably

Serene Grace:
	- King's Rock / Razor Fang:
		- these checks are in ServerHirumaseruCheck
		- just multiply item power by 2

Trace:
	- Role Play is sub_135
	- sub_187 is Trace

Inner Focus / Scrappy:
	- Intimidate blocking: see Oblivious

Soundproof:
	- only block Heal Bell for active Pokemon
		- WS_IYASINOSUZU should already be correct
		- ClientPokemonRefresh is probably what matters, need to test this

Pressure:
	- add popup to message
	- imprison PP: ServerPPCheck
	- snatch PP: uhhhhhhh WS_OIUCHI_CHECK?
	- only affect opponents moves: ServerPPCheck

Run Away:
	- ST_EscapeNGCheck
	- ST_EscapeActCheck
	- sub_003::Nigeashi

Pickup:
	- ServerPokeConditionCheck is the call to check pokemon stuff at the end of the turn
	- will need to extend that routine to support additional end-of-turn checks

Hustle / Rivalry:
	- ST_WazaDamageCalc check for confusionSelfHit

Plus / Minus:
	- ST_WazaDamageCalc check

Sticky Hold:
	- Don't really care tbh lol

Guts:
	- ST_WazaDamageCalc check

Overgrow / Blaze / Torrent / Swarm:
	- ST_WazaDamageCalc check (might not even matter tbh?)

Anger Point:
	- sub_016, do a substitute check (MIGAWARI_CHECK)

Simple:
	- Old method:
		- ST_ServerAgiCalc
		- ST_WazaDamageCalc
		- ServerHitCheck
	- New method:
		- btl_scr_cmd_33_statbuffchange

Normalize:
	- Damage boost: ST_WazaDamageCalc

Magic Guard:
	- Full Para blocking:
		- ServerStatusCheck -> SSC_MAHI
	- sub_099 is toxic spikes

Stall:
	- ST_ServerAgiCalc somewhere

Technician:
	- ST_WazaDamageCalc
	- need to look at how variable base power works

Leaf Guard:
	- Rest is sub_055

Klutz:
	- can override the item check for most of this stuff and it's pretty elegant
	- ST_ServerSoubiItemNoGet has a Klutz check
	- What iron ball effects are not properly ignored??

Mold Breaker:
	- sub_177 is the entry message
	- need to research the dragon tail thing

Super Luck:
	- encount_set::AddPokemonParam has the Compound Eyes check

Anticipation:
	- check is in ST_ServerPokeAppearCheck -> SPAC_KIKENYOCHI

Frisk:
	- check is in ST_ServerPokeAppearCheck -> SPAC_OMITOOSHI

Multitype:
	- Transform code is in WS_HENSIN
	- Modify stuff like Knock Off to check for multitype
